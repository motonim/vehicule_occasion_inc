   'p3' => 'The reasonable lifetime warranty provides that a vehicle must serve for normal use for a reasonable period of time. However, the law does not specify, for example, that a vehicle must have a lifetime of 15 years. Why? Because several factors, such as the price paid, the contract, and the conditions of use, must be taken into account to determine the reasonable lifetime of a vehicle. Thus, a $15 000 vehicle cannot be expected to last as long as another one with the same features, but that costs $30 000.',
